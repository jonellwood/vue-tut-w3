It is not an exact replica of it by any means - however it is my work going through the tutorial as I learn. Where there are differences, errors, and bludners (yes I did that on purpose) they are my own. There is some very redundant a silly CSS in these files owning to the fact that I was grouping exercises by topic and often needed to delineate each exercise while keeping it on the same page as others.

\*And yes I know I need to add alt tags to all those images. I will try and go back and do it. I promise. I do care about a11y.

Where there is intelligent, relevant, and insightful information provided free of charge - that comes from W3Schools and all the great work they do.

Feel free to use these files in any manner that might benefit your learning path - but understand I take no credit for their creation. (I even grabbed their images they use in the tutorial - couldn't event be creative enough to get my own images.)
