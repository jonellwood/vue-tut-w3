    <h1>Vue Computed Properties</h1>
    <span>
        <ul class="green-info">
            <li><b>Computed properties</b> are like data properties, except they depend on other properties.</li>
            <li><b>Computed properties</b> are written like methods, but they do not accept any input arguments.</li>
            <li><b>Computed properties</b> are updated automatically when a dependency changes, while methods are called
                on when something
                happens, like with event handling for example.</li>
            <li><b>Computed properties</b> are used when outputting something that depends on something else.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Computed properties are dynamic</h4>
        <p>The big advantage with a computed property is that it is dynamic, meaning it changes depending on for example
            the value
            of one or more data properties.</p>
        <p>Computed properties is a configuration option in the Vue instance</p>
        <p>As with 'data' and 'method' computed properties also has a reserved name in the Vue instance:
            '<b>computed</b>'</p>
        <p>In the shopping list we used a True or False to ask the user if an item was important. Natural language of
            'Yes' or 'No' would make the form more intuitive. </p>
        <p><em>Computed property is a perfect tool to help with that</em></p>
    </span>

        <h3>Computed Property 'yes; or 'no'</h3>
        <p>In this example we give the user feedback 'yes' or 'no' when the checkbox is toggled. Feedback 'yes' or 'no'
            fits
            better with our everyday language than 'true' or 'false', and we use use a computed property in this example
            to
            achieve this.</p>
        <div id="app">
            <form>
                <p>
                    Important Item?
                    <label>
                        <input type="checkbox" v-model="chbxVal">
                        {{ isImportant }}
                    </label>
                </p>
            </form>
        </div>
    </span>

    <h3>Computed Properties vs. Methods</h3>
    <p>Computed Properties and methods are both written as functions, but they are different</p>
    <ol class="green-info">
        <li><b>Methods</b> runs when called from HTML, but<b>computed properties</b> updates automatically when a
            dependency change.</li>
        <li><b>Computed properties</b> are used the same way we use data properties, but they are dynamic.</li>
    </ol>
